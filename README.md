--Why I made this project--
Nostaligia; I list wanted to look back and see how life looked for me two years ago.

Just click on the url or copy past it into your browser

or

1. Access my github repo
2. click on the "github-pages" under deployments
3. Click on the link that starts with "https"

-- What I struggled with --
The sidebar just would not work most of the time and every small change I made, it would end up being a mess. At the end, after watching tons of YT videos, I could finally make it decent. Its not perfect but it works IG.
